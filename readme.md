# Custom Sounboard app

This a very simple electron app to use a custom soundboard.

As of v1.0.0, the audio is only output to yourself, i will try to make this work with virtual cables for v2, so you can use it in discord and such.

To install, go to the releases and download the latest version.

To add sounds, drop them in a folder named `/sounds` in your downloads folder.
To add lists to classify your sounds, create folders in that directory.
